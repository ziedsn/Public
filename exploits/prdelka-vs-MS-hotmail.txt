Microsoft Hotmail Authentication Bypass Vulnerability [Critical]

Description
	Microsoft Hotmail is one of the leading providers of WebMail. A bug
exists where an unauthenticated user can become an authenticated user to a 
hotmail users email account.

The bug exists when a legitamate hotmail user has signed into a hotmail
account and has not signed out of the account, leaving the session open.
When a user goes to hotmail.com they will be presented with a prompt and
URL similar to the following: http://login.passport.net/uilogin.srf?id=2
 
 Please re-enter your password. 
 Sign in with a different e-mail address. 
 
 E-mail Address   0wn3d@hotmail.com 
 Password: 

To gain access to the previous authenticated session a user is expected
to provide the password to the previous session. This password prompt can
be bypassed via SQL injection using the following URL.

	http://login.passport.net/uilogin.srf?id='

This allows an unauthenticated user to authenticate themselves with the
previous users session. This is a serious issue when hotmail users use
their accounts in a shared system environment - for instance a webcafe 
or library terminal. This and varients of this bug were discovered and
shared with me by my friend Adam.
