              <h2>Hacking Embedded Devices: UART Consoles</h2>
            
            <p>The ‘Hardware Hacking’ scene has exploded recently, 
thanks largely to the widespread adoption of devices such as the Arduino
 and Raspberry PI by the hacking community. Applying hardware hacking 
techniques during product assessments can often give unrivaled levels of
 access to hidden or undocumented functionality particularly when 
reviewing embedded devices such as routers, switches and access points.</p>
<p>Prior to his employment with <span class="caps">MWR</span>, Hacker Fantastic, a Senior Security Consultant with <span class="caps">MWR</span>, reviewed the “<span class="caps">SAGEM</span>
 F@ST2504 Sky Broadband router”, at the time a popular consumer 
broadband device, and documented his findings in a blog post and 
presentation titled <a href="http://blog.hackerfantastic.com/2011/11/hacking-embedded-devices-for-fun-profit.html">Hacking Embedded Devices: For Fun and Profit</a>.
 Matthew has since followed up on his prior work by reviewing the 
“Virgin Media SuperHub” a Cable Modem/Router used by Virgin Media Cable 
in the UK and re-visited his assessment of the “<span class="caps">SAGEM</span> F@ST2504 Sky Broadband router”.</p>
<p>Using physical assessment techniques Matthew has been able to obtain 
full privileged “root” shell capabilities on both the “Virgin Media 
SuperHub” and again on the previously assessed “<span class="caps">SAGEM</span> F@ST2504 Sky Broadband router”.</p>
<p>Both the ‘Virgin’ and ‘Sky’ devices were found to have many more 
in-built capabilities available, or intended, by the ISP’s who issued 
them. Both were found to have advanced networking capabilities such as 
allowing for the manipulation of Media Access Control (<span class="caps">MAC</span>)
 addresses, packet analyzers, the ability to change or review 
configuration data not available within the embedded web services and 
review any credentials configured on the device. It was possible to 
recover the devices firmware and to begin installing custom Operating 
Systems onto the devices enabling users to take full advantage of the 
hardware provided.</p>
<p>This blog post aims to show that the methodologies, tools and 
concepts demonstrated can, and have, worked across multiple devices not 
just those provided by Sky Broadband and Virgin Media.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">UART</span> Hacking</h3>
<p>The goal of the assessment was to obtain the firmware from the device
 so that it could be reverse engineered assisting in efforts to identify
 software vulnerabilities. Additionally, the enablement of a remote 
management service was desirable in order to provide elevated privileges
 to the end-user.</p>
<p>This process began by physically opening the device in order to 
determine the precise hardware in use. Through manual inspection of the 
device’s internals it was possible to obtain the relevant component 
datasheets from the Internet. By using the Integrated Circuit (IC) 
labels of the components, it was possible to build a picture of the 
circuit design and understand the purpose of each of the IC chips on the
 board. There were clear indications of WiFi <span class="caps">NIC</span> devices, Ethernet <span class="caps">NIC</span> controllers, the Microprocessor, Flash chips and more, which could all be easily identified using Google searches.</p>
<p>The Sky Broadband device was previously identified as a re-branded <span class="caps">SAGEM</span>
 F@ST2504 router. The investigation of the Virgin device led to the 
discovery that it is a re-branded Netgear CG3101D wireless router and 
cable modem; this could be derived from stickers on the printed circuit 
board (<span class="caps">PCB</span>). Armed with this information the 
task of locating the schematics of similar devices and data sheets 
became much easier. It also helped when trying to identify potential 
pin-outs from the chipsets on the <span class="caps">PCB</span>, as these are often available by reviewing the device documentation sets.</p>
<p>While reviewing the Virgin Media Super Hub <span class="caps">PCB</span> it was observed that four outputs were not connected to anything close to the Central Processing Unit (<span class="caps">CPU</span>) and appeared marked off on the <span class="caps">PCB</span>. The pins for the Virgin Super Hub can be seen in the image below-left, just beneath the <span class="caps">CPU</span> heat sink; they are outlined in white on the <span class="caps">PCB</span>.
 A similar set of outputs could also be identified on the Sky Broadband 
device and these pins can be seen to the bottom right of the image below
 right. There are many more pins and unsoldered pads on both boards, 
however the close proximity to the <span class="caps">CPU</span>, and because they are grouped in sets of 4 made them of interest.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center">

</div>

<p>These pin outputs were highlighted as a potential area of attack and 
worthy of further investigation. Manufacturers often build in additional
 capabilities to devices that are mass-produced for markets including 
Joint Test Action Group (<span class="caps">JTAG</span>) and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (<span class="caps">UART</span>) interfaces that allow recovery and/or debugging of the device when deploying firmware and/or for engineering purposes.</p>
<p>Investigations began by attaching a <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/multimeter/">multimeter</a> to the outputs and reading the voltage. Three of the outputs read 3.3V and the fourth 0.02V. The fourth pin was ground. A <span class="caps">UART</span>
 or serial interface typically consists of 4 pins, power, transmit, 
receive and ground it was therefore hypothesized that the pins maybe 
utilised for this purpose.</p>
<p>The device was then powered and probes connected to the pins using a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10244"><span class="caps">DSO</span> Nano v2 Oscilloscope</a>,
 as this allows for visualisation of the voltage wave shape as it passes
 along an electronic circuit. Square waveforms were clearly visible on 
one of the pins indicating the likely presence of a data signal. The 
transmission of binary data appears as a square waveform on an 
oscilloscope display. A <a href="http://www.ikalogic.com/ikalogic-products/scanalogic-2/">logic analyzer</a>
 was then used to capture the signals as they were generated from the 
pins on the board. Software was then used to analyze the signal and 
determine its purpose such as potential bus type. The logic analyzer 
identified the output signal as a <span class="caps">UART</span> 
interface, which is essentially a serial port that had been left in by 
the manufacturer and not connected for use. An example of the output of 
the logic analysis can be seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Hacking%20Embedded%20Devices_%20UART%20Consoles%20-%20MWR%20Labs_files/logic-analysis.jpg" alt="logic-analysis"></p>
<p>The pin-out configuration for a <span class="caps">UART</span> is typically power (<span class="caps">VCC</span>),
 transmit (TX), receive (RX) and ground (V-). It was possible to see 
data being transmitted on the TX pin and with some experimentation with 
probes and the aforementioned tools, the RX pin was easily located. It 
transpired that only a TX, RX and <span class="caps">GND</span> pin need
 to be connected for functionality on both of these devices and that the
 power pin could be ignored. Repeating the same process with the Sky 
Broadband device exposed a similar configuration for a <span class="caps">UART</span> that could be used to interface with a serial console on the device.</p>
<p>For a temporary connection and to begin interacting with the device without soldering, it is possible to make use of a <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">Bus Pirate</a>.
 A Bus Pirate is the Swiss army knife for electronics hobbyists and 
hardware hackers that allows for interfacing with many different types 
of hardware bus lines. The Bus Pirate allows for quick and clean <span class="caps">UART</span> monitoring and/or interaction. Alternatively <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/718">FT232-RL</a> based board can be utilised to quickly add a serial console that can allow a computer to interface with the <span class="caps">UART</span>. The console can then be accessed over a Universal Serial Bus (<span class="caps">USB</span>) connection.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">IKA</span>-<span class="caps">LOGIC</span> 
tools were used to automatically identify the baud rates in use, 
although this can also be done with trial and error in a terminal 
program such as minicom or hyperterminal. A configuration setting of 
115200bps (8N1) with no hardware or software flow control enabled was 
found to be the necessary setting for serial communication to both the 
Virgin and Sky devices. This process requires experimentation and 
persistence. Many different configurations were attempted and required 
the sampling of logic signals and analysis at different clock speeds.</p>
<p>Accessing the console on the Virgin Media SuperHub it was discovered 
that the console prompt was non-interactive. In order to interact with 
the device OS, further work was required, although some diagnostic 
information could be obtained from the non-interactive output. The 
device allows for configuration via non-volatile memory, facilitated by 
uploading a configuration binary file via the web interface. The screen 
shot below illustrates this.</p>
<p><img src="Hacking%20Embedded%20Devices_%20UART%20Consoles%20-%20MWR%20Labs_files/vmsh-web-interface.jpg" alt="vmsh-web-interface"></p>
<p>The dynamic state is actually located on the flash memory chip. A 
memory configuration from a similar device with an older configuration 
was located by downloading “GatewaySettings.bin” files from similar 
devices, older Virgin devices and Internet forums. The console state is 
set within the configuration data enabling an interactive shell once the
 settings binary from one of these devices had been uploaded. This 
allowed for a full interactive shell and complete control over the 
Virgin Media SuperHub.<br>
 <br>
With interactive access obtained it was possible to explore the eCos 
(embedded configurable OS) device further. From this interactive console
 state it was possible to read and write to the flash chip and resident 
memory; meaning it was possible to obtain the compressed firmware 
images. From the eCos <span class="caps">CLI</span> it was possible to 
extract the contents of the flash chip meaning that the compressed 
firmware, backup firmware, boot loader could be downloaded as well as 
dynamic and permanent (non-user definable) storage areas. Additionally 
by exploring the <code>read_memory</code> command it was possible to 
extract the uncompressed OS as it was running from resident memory on 
the device. MD5 sums of the extracted files from the flash storage can 
be seen in the terminal output below.</p>
<pre><code>$ md5 *.bin
MD5 (Bootloader.bin) = cd7508c75654cb0b89351997dbd569d6
MD5 (Dynamic.bin) = 18a8bfaf1f020100e2859dc876bc7965
MD5 (Image1.bin) = 4ea12f34807671a5e1e103362b1c8ea5
MD5 (Image2.bin) = c8c16d696654f4f11c83b2ad73dbdff7
MD5 (Perm.bin) = 1572d197ac4e0a7c33351f49d0fff837</code></pre>
<p>The level of access obtained allowed for further study of the device 
and achieved the goal of being able to analyze the firmware for 
vulnerabilities. It was also possible to install a custom OS onto the 
device and enable additional functionality not normally accessible to an
 end user.</p>
<p>The same approach was applied to the Sky Broadband device, where it was discovered that the device was a Broadcom <span class="caps">CPU</span> Linux based device. Additionally, a <span class="caps">SAGEM</span>
 boot loader could be accessed, as well as an interactive captive 
BusyBox menu. The menu required authentication; the default combination 
of admin/sky was used. It was then possible to gain access to a full 
interactive root shell just by entering <code>sh</code> at the prompt. 
This allowed for the complete control of the device and further 
exploration of its capabilities. The screen shots below illustrate the 
interactive access achieved on both devices assessed.</p>
