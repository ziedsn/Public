Another sad story inside the world of consumer insecurities, this time
a look at the British Telecom provided "infinity" CPE. BT provide two
pieces of equipment, one is the flagship BTHub3 which provides WiFi
and user networking the other is a Huawei DSL modem for provisioning
internet to the hub. This is a look inside the Huawei modem, where it
was discovered a JTAG and UART pin-out were provided and cleanly
labelled near the main CPU as two blocks of 5 pins, allowing a 10pin
header to be soldered to the device. It was discovered that the UART
provides the serialoutput of the device during boot and it is possible
to interact with the bootloader from then on. A BusPirate was used in
the making of this movie.

The BootLoader identifies itself during POST as the following, identifying
also the chipset type and versions in use:

With access to the bootloader obtained, an attacker can halt the
boot process and make use of the bootloader to modify the boot
parameters, additionally they may reprogram the MAC address of the
device to arbitrary values using the "b" Change board parameters

After booting the modem runs a restrictive Huwaei configuration shell
that can be used for basic diagnositics and Administrative tasks. The
default username and password is "admin" / "admin". After authentication
you can execute a limited BusyBox ash shell using the "shell" command:

Alarmingly, the BT ADSL router device is configured in an out-of-the
box configuration state to be remotely managed and controlled by unknown
parties. The following netstat output shows that "tftp", "ssh" and "telnet"
management services are running with full root privileges and listening
on network interfaces, which are configured as bridges to physical 
connections:

By reconfiguring the network connection it was discovered that an attacker 
could authenticate to the limited shell using the default "admin" shell
and gain access to the device over a network interface:

[fantastic@localhost ro]$ ssh -l admin 192.168.2.1
admin@192.168.2.1's password: 
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0

network traffic rules indicate that this is intended to be restrictive
functionality and only reachable from an upstream ISP providor - however
with such an insecure password security does not seem to be a primary
concern. Additionally a "BTAgent" process and configuration directory
has been identified which appears to be a network management agent that
performs polling for upstream firmware (to allow the device to be 
reflashed) and may also contain security vulnerabilities that could 
allow reprogramming of the device from a remote location. These 
files consist of a number of libraries and binaries and appear to make
some use of PKI although this maybe just to validate a firmware
image file as opposed to authentication.
